This is an example Arduino/MSP430 demo for the Epaper development board.

	Works with all our EPaper development boards:

To use, simply copy the demo and library folder to your working directory.

Wiring to Arduino Board:

Pin TEMPERATURE = A0
Pin PANEL_ON = 2
Pin BORDER = 3
Pin DISCHARGE = 4
Pin PWM = 5
Pin RESET = 6
Pin BUSY = 7
Pin EPD_CS = 8
Pin FLASH_CS = 9
Pin SW2 = 12

You will also need to wire the up the SPI interface which is specific to the board you are using.
